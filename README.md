## Watchdog System

The browser includes a watchdog system that automatically restarts the browser if it crashes and restores your last open tabs.

### How it works:
- The watchdog runs as a **completely separate independent process**
- It monitors the main browser process by checking PID files
- If the browser crashes, it automatically restarts it
- Your last open tabs are automatically restored
- The watchdog runs **silently** with no console output
- The watchdog **automatically starts** when the main browser starts
- The watchdog executable is located in the same directory as the main browser

### Automatic Startup:
- The watchdog **automatically starts** when you run the main browser
- No manual intervention required
- The watchdog executable is included in the installer package
- The watchdog is located in the same directory as the main browser executable

### Manual Control (Development Only):
```bash
# For development/testing
npm run start-watchdog
# OR
start-watchdog.bat
# OR
node watchdog.js
```

### Features:
- The watchdog process is completely independent from the main browser
- The watchdog runs **silently** with no console output
- The watchdog will attempt to restart the browser up to 5 times
- The watchdog executable is a standalone file (no Node.js required)
- The watchdog executable is included in the installer package

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- **Framework**: Electron
